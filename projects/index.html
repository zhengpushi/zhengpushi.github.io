	  <h3>CoqMatrix</h3>
	  <p>This is a formal matrix library in Coq, and integrated with multiple different implementations.</p>
	  <p>Our goal is to provide a unified framework for different implementations of formalized matrix libraries, so as to decouple the differences between underlying technologies and upper-level applications.</p>

	  <h3>VFCS</h3>
	  <p>
		Verified Flight Control System (VFCS) is an academic project for study the FCS software by theorem prover Coq.
		We adopt the idea of construct-correct to analysis, modeling and design the FCS.
		Coq proof assistant is a higher-order logic theorem prover based on Calculus of Inductive Constructions.
		We mainly study the Multicopter at the first stage.

	  <h3>FinMatrix</h3>
	  <p>
		FinMatrix is a formal matrix library in Coq, which we started from finite sets (over natural numbers), vecotr based on finite sets, and matrices based on vectors.
		This implementation differs from the <a href="/projects/CoqMatrix/">CoqMatrix</a> project, which have various models.
		We have formalized many algebraic and geometric vector or matrix theories, especially including two inversion matrix algorithms: minvGE (inversion based on Gauss Elimination), minvAM (inversion based on Adjoint Matrix).

	  <h3>OrienRepr</h3>
	  <p>
		OrienRepr is a formal verification project in Coq, for "Orientation Representation (OR)" problem, which is focused on derivation of popular models or algorithms for OR, including Euler Angles, Rotation Matrices, Axis-Angles, and Unit Quaternion.
