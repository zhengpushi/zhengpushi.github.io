		<h3>VFCS</h3>
		<p>Verified Flight Control System (VFCS) is an academic project for study the FCS software by theorem prover Coq.</p>
		<p>We adopt the idea of construct-correct to analysis, modeling and design the FCS.</p>
		<p>Coq proof assistant is a higher-order logic theorem prover based on Calculus of Inductive Constructions.</p>
		<p>We mainly study the Multicopter at the first stage.</p>

		<h3>Formalization of Two Inversion Matrix Algorithms with FinMatrix</h3>
		<p>We started from finite sets, constructed vectors based on finite sets, and matrices based on vectors.
		  This implementation differs from he extensive nature of the CoqMatrix project, but uses only one model for in-depth matrix theory development.

			<h4>FinMatrix with Inversion Matrix by Gauss Elimination & Adjoin Matrix</h4>
			The first stage result is the formalization of two inverse matrix algorithms based on Gaussian elimination and adjoint matrix-based.
			The HTML documentation for this stage is recorded here for sharing and archiving.
