	  <h2>Homepage of ZhengPu Shi</h2>
	  I am a Ph.D. student at Nanjing University of Aeronautics and Astronautics from 2021 to 2024.
	  <br/>
	  My main research direction is formal verification and theorem proving.
	  <br/>

	  Here are some projects charged by me.

	  <article>
		<h2>CoqMatrix</h2>
		<p>This is a formal matrix library in Coq, and integrated with multiple different implementations.</p>
		<p>Our goal is to provide a unified framework for different implementations of formalized matrix libraries, so as to decouple the differences between underlying technologies and upper-level applications.</p>
		<p> The detail please go to <a href="https://github.com/zhengpushi/CoqMatrix/">CoqMatrix github homepage</a></p>

		<h2>VFCS</h2>
		<p>Verified Flight Control System (VFCS) is an academic project for study the FCS software by theorem prover Coq.</p>
		<p>We adopt the idea of construct-correct to analysis, modeling and design the FCS.</p>
		<p>Coq proof assistant is a higher-order logic theorem prover based on Calculus of Inductive Constructions.</p>
		<p>We mainly study the Multicopter at the first stage.</p>
